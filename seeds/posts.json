Once innovative ideas have become commonplace, and certain biological models (butterfly color! streamlined beaks!) have celebrity status in the marketplace of sustainable design.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\"><\/div><\/div><div class=\"wp-block-columns gap-2 is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-layout-3 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\"><div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-default wp-duotone-purple-yellow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8000\/wp-content\/uploads\/protect-3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-73\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8000\/wp-content\/uploads\/protect-3.webp 768w, http:\/\/localhost:8000\/wp-content\/uploads\/protect-3-300x300.webp 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8000\/wp-content\/uploads\/protect-3-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure><\/div><div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full wp-duotone-blue-orange\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8000\/wp-content\/uploads\/protect-3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-73\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8000\/wp-content\/uploads\/protect-3.webp 768w, http:\/\/localhost:8000\/wp-content\/uploads\/protect-3-300x300.webp 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8000\/wp-content\/uploads\/protect-3-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure><\/div><\/div><div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-layout-4 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\"><div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\"><\/div><div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%\"><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Species at Work Together<\/h4><p>The biggest story though has been the growth and expansion of a globe-circling community of biomimics. You can hear from dozens of them in the video below.<\/p><p>They develop innovations, reimagine systems and processes, and help established organizations to implement practices that support engagement with biomimicry. They add to our understanding of nature through primary research and the surfacing of long-held cultural knowledge. And they spread the word: They enlist partners, motivate colleagues, and educate and inspire the next generation.<\/p><\/div><\/div><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Highlights From a Quarter Century of Innovation<\/h4><p><em>Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature<\/em>&nbsp;also set the storytelling pattern that AskNature follows to this day: profiling life\u2019s endless adaptations and the human innovations they have inspired. Author and Biomimicry Institute co-founder Janine Benyus focused on a few promising areas of development: food, energy, materials, medicine, computing (it was the dawn of the cyber era!), and the conducting of business itself.<\/p><p>Below, explore some of the innovations biomimics around the world have developed over the past 25 years. Some look to the same biological models and take different approaches to applying them. Some perform similar functions but have looked to drastically different models. Some, like The Land Institute, were featured in the book in 1997, and have continued to deliver on and expand upon the promise they showed a quarter century ago.<\/p><p>Each one could be a solution you\u2019ve been looking for, an inspiration to apply the same model in a new way, or the motivation to break new ground of your own. The next 25 years start today.<\/p><p>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/asknature.org\/collection\/25th-anniversary\/\">https:\/\/asknature.org\/collection\/25th-anniversary\/<\/a><\/p><p><\/p>",
